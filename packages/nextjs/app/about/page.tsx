            ArLib.me is a public goods community project to map and catalog mini libraries by Jan. 31, 2025. Mini
            libraries are more than book collections—they&apos;re neighborhood gems of creativity and connection. ArLib
            puts these spaces on the map and in your pocket, making it easy to explore, share, and discover books
            nearby. Each cataloged book links to its openlibrary.org page, helping you decide your next great read
            effortlessly!{" "}

            Mini libraries are a public goods. We need a burst to get as many mini-libraries online as possible by the
            end of January. <strong>Enter quests.</strong> People hunt to discover new libraries and catalog its
            contents to compete for points. Quests are more fun with real rewards! Sure, bragging rights are cool, but
            how about points that can turn into something tangible, like money or gift cards to local businesses?
            Imagine earning something of value for putting libraries online—or for refreshing the catalog while on a dog
            walk. For some it is not about the money. But we know incentives work. The prize-to-points ratio?
            That&apos;s the exciting part—it depends on how many sponsors and funds join the quest! Gamification ideas
            are flowing, and we&apos;re just getting started. Will there be a golden ticket? Got thoughts or want to
            chip in ideas or funds? Let&apos;s team up and make it happen—reach out{" "}

          <p className="text-lg mt-4">
            You start earning points the moment you add a library or a book—no sign-up. Your points belong to an
            anonymous account with a random name like &ldquo;Reader K7Q2M&rdquo;. To keep them if you clear your browser
            or switch devices, tap <strong>Save with passkey</strong>: your phone or password manager creates a passkey,
            secured by Face ID, Touch ID or your device PIN, and you can sign in with it anywhere. The site stores no
            email, name or password—only your random name, your points and the passkey&apos;s public key. Leaderboards
            show random names only. If rewards are introduced in the future, points will determine eligibility, and you
            will be able to link a wallet to your account then.
