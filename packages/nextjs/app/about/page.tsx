            ArLib.me is a public goods community project to map and catalog mini libraries by Jan. 31, 2025. Mini
            libraries are more than book collections‚Äîthey&apos;re neighborhood gems of creativity and connection. ArLib
            puts these spaces on the map and in your pocket, making it easy to explore, share, and discover books
            nearby. Each cataloged book links to its openlibrary.org page, helping you decide your next great read
            effortlessly!{" "}

            Mini libraries are a public goods. We need a burst to get as many mini-libraries online as possible by the
            end of January. <strong>Enter quests.</strong> People hunt to discover new libraries and catalog its
            contents to compete for points. Quests are more fun with real rewards! Sure, bragging rights are cool, but
            how about points that can turn into something tangible, like money or gift cards to local businesses?
            Imagine earning something of value for putting libraries online‚Äîor for refreshing the catalog while on a dog
            walk. For some it is not about the money. But we know incentives work. The prize-to-points ratio?
            That&apos;s the exciting part‚Äîit depends on how many sponsors and funds join the quest! Gamification ideas
            are flowing, and we&apos;re just getting started. Will there be a golden ticket? Got thoughts or want to
            chip in ideas or funds? Let&apos;s team up and make it happen‚Äîreach out{" "}

            Claiming points requires setting up a passcode-protected account. For simplicity, we use a Coinbase smart
            wallet. No personal data is collected or stored by the site. Your passcode is stored only on your device and
            secured by Face ID, Touch ID, or your password manager. The site only stores the public wallet address
            associated with your account‚Äîno email, name, or other PII is required. This ensures your account remains
            pseudonymous. Leaderboards are pseudonymous and designed for fun. Your public account address and points are
            visible to everyone. If rewards are introduced in the future, points will determine eligibility.
