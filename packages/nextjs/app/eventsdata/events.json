How are businesses managing the electricity situation and tight labor market? Will the war end in 2025? The Forum will convene global leaders, experts, and humanitarians for a daylong forum to identify solutions to the most pressing challenges impacting human and planetary health. Among the panels are “U.S. Policy Towards Russia” and “Strategic Dialogue on the War in Ukraine.” Winternational offers a one-of-a-kind experience featuring representatives from over 60 embassies – including Ukraine (visit stand #62) - promoting their countries through vibrant and interactive displays of visual art, food, and handcrafts, as well as travel, tourism and trade. A weekly vigil to pray the rosary for peace in Ukraine - rain or shine - in front of the Russian Embassy. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus has operated as an extension of Russia. Lukashenka has become instrumental in carrying out Putin’s war and shielding him from accountability. This hearing will examine the unequal partnership between Russia & Belarus in the context of the war. Former President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, who conducted a successful defense of his country when Russia launched its hybrid war on Ukraine in 2014, remains outspoken on the need to give Ukraine the means to prevent a Putin victory. Please join to raise continued awareness about the full-scale war in Ukraine; show the people of Ukraine that we remember them and stand with Ukraine; advocate for essential military assistance for Ukraine to win the war faster and with fewer casualties; and thank the U.S. for Standing with Ukraine. The program includes: Christmas candleholder (made with natural materials), gingerbread cookie decoration, making Christmas earrings, and hand-painted Christmas cards. After the workshops, guests will gather for the Christmas Tree lighting ceremony and a special meeting with St. Nicholas. The chorus will present \"A Ukrainian Christmas\" [\"Українське Різдво\"] concert. Join us as we ring in the joyous holiday season with the magical sound of Ukraine's national instrument, the bandura. Proceeds from the concert will support humanitarian aid for Ukrainian wounded warriors. St. Bartholomew’s Choir will present Handel's Messiah (Part I). The choir will be accompanied by strings, oboe, trumpet, and organ. Donations benefit the Cathedral School of Sts. Peter & Paul in the US Virgin Islands and the Ukrainian Humanitarian Center at St. Andrew’s Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral. ",
